# SarcasticClipboard
Copy text, and paste in sarcasm case
### Looks like this: 
> "yeah sure i'll get right on that" -> "YeAh sUrE I'Ll gEt rIgHt oN ThAt"

Great for sarcastic people who are tired of manually typing their sarcasm. With this script and the help of the [pyperclip](https://github.com/asweigart/pyperclip) module from Al Sweigart, you can copy any text and paste it sarcasticly.

## Usage:
1. Run script
2. While script is running, any text you copy to your clipboard will be made sArCasTiC
3. You can enter certain commands to the script while its running to configure options for sarcasm formatting
4. Enter 'help' to see the list of available commands
5. To quit, type 'quit' or simply close the terminal window

**Note**: Formatting is applied to clipboard text _after copying_ , not after pasting. If you change formatting settings during the runtime, you won't see them applied until you've copied some new text.
